# Image-Classification-with-EfficientNetV2

This repository contains code for an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes a script for training the model, a script for predicting new images using the trained model, and a sample dataset of images for testing.

## Getting Started

To run the script in this repository, you will need a Unix based system with Bash and Python installed. You should also have a Python script that you want to automate the execution of.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
tensorflow
keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Train the model:

    python image_classification.py


2. Predict an image:

    python predict_image.py

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available at link to dataset.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.
